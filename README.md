## Our Discord App ‚ú®
This app has been specifically setup to _exclusively_ work in the Starry server ~~and in my debug server.~~
- Any other server will prompt an error on arrival.
- App running on version 2.0.a, report errors to our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/luau)

~~You may whitelist any servers however by modifying the allowed servers array in `.env`~~
