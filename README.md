## Our Discord App ✨
This app has been specifically setup to _exclusively_ work in the Starry server, and in my debug server.
- Any other server will prompt an error on arrival.

You may whitelist any servers however by modifying the allowed servers array in `.env`

---

## Settings ⚙️
Our global prefixes include, but are not limited to:
- `s.`
- `?`
- `/`

## Modules 📜
> [!WARNING]
> Commands like the **`default-roles`** command take a _long_ time to finish, depending on the server's size.
### Admin Only
1. **`s.sync`** : Re-syncs the command tree to update commands
> This command should be used after coding a new command
2. **`purge`** : Deletes (x) amount of messages from the current channel
3. **`default-roles`** : Automatically re-assigns the default roles to every member of the guild
> You can configure which role(s) you'd like via the list in the command
### Available for All
1. **`ping`** : Gives the latency in MS and returns if it's fast or slow
